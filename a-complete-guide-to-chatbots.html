                                Chatbots had their boom back in 2016 when Facebook opened Messenger for Chatbots and since then there's been no looking back. 
                                According to a Forbes report, the Chatbot market is forecasted to reach $1.25billion by 2025.

                            <h2>What is a Chatbot ?</h2>
                            <p>A chatbot is an AI-based computer program that replicates
                                 human-like conversations with users via text messages or
                                  even voice. They can also be called digital assistants that
                                   understand the potential of humans. Bots interpret and
                                    process the user requests and give answers relevant
                                     to the prompt. In simple words, a bot is software that
                                      is designed to communicate with human users through
                                       the internet.</p>

                            <h2>How do Chatbots work ?</h2>
                            <p>Chatbots work by analyzing and identifying the purpose of the user's intention.
                                 They run on pre-programmed responses, artificial intelligence,or both.
                                  Based on the mechanism used,chatbots process user's questions in order
                                   to delivera parallel response. A chatbot is programmed to work separately
                                    from a human operator.</p>      
                               <p>The chatbots work by adapting three categorization methods.</p>
                         </div>

                                    <h2>Pattern-Matching</h2>
                                    <p>Pattern-Matching bots organize text and produce a response based on the keywords they find.
                                         AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language)
                                          is the standard structure for these patterns. Abot is able to find the right
                                           answer in the related and correlated pattern although it cannot gobeyond
                                            the patterns already applied into its system.
                                        </p>   
            
                                           <p class="bulidingscratch">
                                               Another choice today's chatbots have is to use algorithms.
                                               A unique pattern is available in the database for every type of question.
                                                Which helps the bot in providing the right response.
                                                 Ahierarchical structure can also be formed with the help of various combinations of trends.
                                                 Two more methods using the algorithms are NLU and NLP.

                                        Now that we’ve gained knowledge on how chatbots work, let us also have a look at the Types of Chatbots.
                                         Based on the applied mechanism, a chatbot processes user's data to deliver quick responses to all their
                                          requests. Mechanisms used couldbe pre-defined rules or AI-based.There are 3 types of Chatbots available today :

                                            Also known as command-based, keyword, or transactional chatbots.
                                             They communicate using predefined paths during conversations.
                                              At each step in the conversation, the user will need to pick from the precise options that determine the next step.
                                               Rule-based chatbots provide answers based on a set of if or then rules that can vary in complexity.
                                                A chatbot designer is the one who defines and implements these rules.

                                            Let's say a rule-based chatbot is asked a question like "How to change my email?".
                                             It firstly searches for familiar keywords in the sentence. Here it will look for keywords like 'change' and 'email'.
                                              IT will then match the keywords with available responses in its database to process the answer. In case,
                                               if anything out of the scope of an AI chatbot is presented, it will fail to matchthat question with an answer.

                                             Chatbots are definitely here to stay. We already have them in our computers,
                                             phones, smart devices and they've become an important part of our life.
                                             The chatbot technology is helping bot businesses and users in handling
                                              easy and dull tasks quickly. Although they can't replace human-like
                                             conversation but are still helping us.
