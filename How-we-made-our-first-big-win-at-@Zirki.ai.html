                            <p class="bulidingscratch">It was one of the shiny noons of August 2017, and as usual,
                                 I was sitting in front of my desktop screen, searching for something interesting to do.
                                  Suddenly the phone rang, It was one of my good mentors/ guides  Mr Krishna at
                                   another end. This time, he has, an interesting problem to solve.
                                 </p>


                              
                            <img src="./assets/img/user.jpg" alt="img" class="img-fluid bulidingscratch">                                
        
                        
        
                          <p class="bulidingscratch">One of his clients was looking for a marketing and promotion solution
                               which can directly communicate their message to the audience and can keep track of effective
                                marketing states. The client was Sony music entertainment.</p>                                 

                          <p class="bulidingscratch">They have one of the most popular music band in the middle east
                               called "The5". A pop boy band composed of Kazem Chamas, Ahmed Hassan, Adil Echbiy,
                                Said Karmouz and Mohamed Bouhezza (aka BMD). They finished second in the fourth
                                 series of the Arabic televised singing competition The X Factor Arabia in 2015 and are
                                  currently considered the most popular boy band in the Middle East region.</p>

                          <p class="bulidingscratch">They had a huge fan following in the entire Arab region. Most
                               of their audience was 18-35 year old, who was not consuming advertisement and
                                promotional content via traditional marketing platforms like newspaper, television
                                 and hoardings. They were spending millions of dollars on it but didn't get measurable
                                  success. They were unable to get exact data or statics if fans are getting their
                                   communicated message via social media marketing or camping. </p>
      



                          <p class="bulidingscratch">Band members were not able to engage with their audience directly,
                               were not able to share their message with their fans interactively. It was leading them to lose
                                their fan base.</p>                                 
                            
                                
                                
                                
                          <img src="./assets/img/communication.jpg" alt="img" class="img-fluid bulidingscratch">     
                          <p class="imgesource">If you are not responding your audience, you are losing them.</p> 

                                 
                           
                          <p class="bulidingscratch">There was the lack of an interactive marketing and advertisement
                               platform which can connect fans with their stars and stars with their fans. The analytical
                                system to get perfect statics of data if the marketing campaign works, were missing.</p>   


                          <p class="bulidingscratch">There was a lack of transparency the client was not able to check the real statistics
                               and data, provided by their marketing agencies.</p>    
                               
                           <p class="bulidingscratch">Behind this, only one thing was responsible the absence of creativity, thoughts
                                and utilisation of available resources with proficiency. After hearing this, on phone call,
                                 my mind flickered! Why not grab this opportunity and provide them with the best solution.
                                  On phone call, I assured him of a solution and got ready for the project planning.</p>    
                                




                          <img src="./assets/img/child.jpg" alt="img" class="img-fluid bulidingscratch"> 
                          <p class="bulidingscratch">At that movement, we had some traditional solutions like Facebook Advertisement,
                               blogging, content marketing, Youtube advertisement in mind, but they were only
                                limited to broadcasting our message to the target audience. Our need was two-way
                                 communication and 100% analytics of statics data if the audience is consuming our
                                  content. We chose Facebook Messenger Chatbot to do our work.</p>    
               
                          
                          
                          <p class="bulidingscratch">A chatbot is a computer programme which use natural language
                               processing and artificial intelligence to solve users query and provide them with a
                                interactive way to communicate and do their tasks via an application.</p>

                            <p class="bulidingscratch">The day begins, and according to plan, Mr Krishna forwarded us the first script of the chatbot. which was looking like this.</p>

                          <p class="bulidingscratch">Everything was clear in our mind, me with my teammate

                               started to work on this project. We built a Chatbot for the <b>The5</b> official page.
                                Script had a really great story line and content. We included videos, games,
                                 exclusive links, likes and the personality of the band members in the Chatbot.
                                  We set the broadcast of our first-day update message and started to monitor
                                   our success with the project.</p>

                               they started to subscribe chatbot for latest updates and exclusive album details.
                                It also gave us surety about message delivery to the inbox.</p>

                                    Chatbot was responding to fans and due to that page response rate blew up.</p>
